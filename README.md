# Encryption System and prime number finders

/**
 * Programer: Pravesh Jung Karki
 * CSC 240 Programming05
 * Encryption System Description: A program to encode and decode messages using a shift by N cypher.
 * This program will ask the user if they want to encode or decode.
 * Then it will ask them to enter the text (either the original plane text, or the encoded text).
 * Then it will ask them to enter the shift N (1 to 25).  Then  we will execute the encode/decode and display the result.
 * And we will again ask the user if they want to do it again, or we will stop the program.
 *
 * Prime number Finder Description: In this program  we use
 * a variation of what is called "The Sieve of Eratosthenes" to find
 * the prime numbers. At first we will ask for the lower bound and
 * upper bound from the user and then give them the prime numbers
 * within that bound. We will use pointer to execute different functions.
