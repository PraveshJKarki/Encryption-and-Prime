# Encryption System and prime number finders

/**
 * Programer: Pravesh Jung Karki
 * Description: A program to encode and decode messages using a shift by N cypher.
 * This program will ask the user if they want to encode or decode.
 * Then it will ask them to enter the text (either the original plane text, or the encoded text).
 * Then it will ask them to enter the shift N (1 to 25).  Then  we will execute the encode/decode and display the result.
 * And we will again ask the user if they want to do it again, or we will stop the program.
